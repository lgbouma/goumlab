Summary: The observational theme continues, now with Saturn and globulars!

Continuing the theme from [my previous
post](http://lgbouma.com/2016/seeing_jupiter.html), I took some more pictures
this morning and wanted to share them.

I hope you enjoy these -- I enjoyed taking them! Descriptions follow the images
below.

### 1) is Saturn and its ring(s). 

These rings really deserve their own post -- the 
theory behind their stability and structure has centuries of history, and has
flourished with Cassini's close-up images.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn) has some incredible
pictures.

### 2)-4) are all "globular clusters".

These are ancient stellar systems with tens to
hundreds of thousands of stars, tightly bound by gravity.
The first is M92, a cluster that is at least
[10 billion years old](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.5217v1.pdf).
Second is M3, a half-million star globular cluster of comparable age 
in Canes Venatici (near the big dipper / plow / Ursa Major).
Finally, M13 is a globular cluster in the armpit of the Hercules constellation.


## Next steps

I'm still new at this, but I hear postprocessing (i.e. photoshopping)
can be useful to subtract out artifacts in the images, and to subsequently
prettify them.
Aside from that and looking at new objects, I have a few 
other things planned for future mini-projects. Check back soon!
