<p>A pretty surprising observational result in astronomy is the radial velocity distribution
of galaxies. First things first: for our purposes, there are two major classes of 
galaxies, (1) spiral (like our own Milky Way), and (2) ellipticals (which unsurprisingly
are roughly ellipsoids in space). There's another major class called lenticular but let's
not talk about that.</p>
<p>Anyway, so you look at the light coming from a spiral galaxy in a fancy telescope, and your 
first thought is 
probably something like: "it's SPINNING!". How is it spinning? Is the "outside" moving faster
than the core? Yup. But not how you might expect: if we presume that most of the mass 
in the galaxy is at its core,
then we should expect the radial velocity of the galaxy to be 0 at its center, for it
to increase up to some point, and to eventually fall off as the inverse square-root of the 
radial distance from the core (I still need LaTeX integration, obviously, but in a Newtonian
approximation this is just saying that the kinetic energy of some object far away from 
the galaxy sees the mass of the galaxy as a point gravitational attractor).  </p>
<p>But this isn't what's observed. The behavior near the center is about what we expect,
but as we go further out, we don't hit the turning point! By measuring the Doppler-shift
of light coming from stars in these galaxies, we can infer that the radial velocity at
the outer edges of spiral (and elliptical) galaxies is roughly <em>constant</em>.</p>
<p>What's going on? Our <em>only</em> assumption was about the mass distribution of the galaxy.
So that must be wrong. There must be some unseen mass, not in the form of stars. 
Fixing a hypothetical mass distribution to match the dynamics
of the galaxies, we find that the mass must be proportional to the radial distance from
the galaxy center. I.e., going outward, the MASS is going up, but the light is STOPPING.
It turns out that some of this mass is in the form of gas (mostly hydrogen) that just doesn't
shine very brightly, but a lot of it is still unaccounted for. 
So this is an <em>unsolved problem</em>. The deficit is called `dark matter'. </p>
<h1>Orbits and the Logarithmic Potential</h1>
<p>Okay, so past some characteristic length both spiral and elliptical galaxies
have constant rotation velocity. What path do stars take as these spin around in them?  </p>
<p>I really need LaTeX integration here, because it's two easy equations:
centripetal acceleration in terms of potential, and solution for constant velocity.</p>
<p>As part of my homework for a class, I looked at the path a single star travels, over
billions of years, in a galaxy. These paths are plotted in grey lines below. I set up
the markers to tick about 50 times per radial orbit. The images shown are for 50, 100, 200,
300, ..., 1000 orbits. </p>

<p>To-do for building the website:</p>
<ol>
<li>Figure out LaTeX compatibility, and update this post with equations. </li>
<li>Figure out a better figure embed method, update this post and old ones to make em nice.</li>
<li>Add comments!</li>
<li>Actually write an update post on grad-school and research related topics.</li>
<li>Write a blog post about Charles Adler's cool OoM book.</li>
</ol>
