        <h1><a href="http://lgbouma.com/2015/orbits-and-update.html">Orbits in a logarithmic potential, and an update!</a></h1>
        <h1>Pictures of galaxies show you 10% of what's there (by mass).</h1>
<p>A pretty surprising observational result in astronomy is the radial
velocity distribution of galaxies. First things first: for our purposes,
there are two major classes of galaxies, (1) spiral (like our own Milky
Way), and (2) ellipticals (which unsurprisingly are roughly ellipsoids in
space). There are complications but let's not talk about them.</p>
<p>Anyway, so you look at a spiral galaxy in a fancy telescope, and your first
gut reaction (after maybe, "wow") is probably something like: "it's
SPINNING!".</p>
<p>Is it really? Yes. But not how you might expect. If you just look at the galaxy,
you might think that most of its mass is where it's brightest - the center.
Following this logic, if we wanted to guess the velocity of something far
from the center (like say, our sun from the center of the Milky Way), we
would write down a Newtonian circular motion equation like
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
\frac{v^2}{r}\propto \frac{1}{r^2},
\label{eq:kepler}
\end{equation}</div>
<p>
for <span class="math">\(v\)</span> the velocity of our 'point particle' and <span class="math">\(r\)</span> its distance from the center
of the galaxy. The symbol <span class="math">\(\propto\)</span> means "proportional to", and Eq.
<span class="math">\(\ref{eq:kepler}\)</span> is essentially a statement that the (centripetal) acceleration
of our 'test particle' (the star) is proportional to a force that falls off
as the inverse square of the particle's distance from the galaxy's center -
just Newtonian mechanics!</p>
<p>Rearranging, this means that we would expect the velocity of stars in
galaxies to fall off as <span class="math">\(r^{-1/2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is not what's observed. It turns out, the behavior near the center is about what we expect for there being a lot of mass there, but as we go further out,
the velocity of stars with respect to the galactic center <em>barely</em> decreases!</p>
<p>What's going on? Our <em>only</em> assumption was about the mass distribution of the galaxy. So that must be wrong. There must be some unseen mass, not in the form
of stars. Fixing a hypothetical mass distribution to match the dynamics
of the galaxies (stars have constant velocity out to the edge of where we see
them), we find that the mass must be proportional to the radial distance from
the galaxy center. In other words, going outward, the MASS is going up, but
the light we see from stars is disappearing.
It turns out that some of this mass is in the form of gas (mostly hydrogen) that just doesn't shine very brightly, but a lot of it is still unaccounted for.</p>
<p>This is an <em>unsolved problem</em>. The deficit is called 'dark matter'.</p>
<h1>Orbits and the Logarithmic Potential</h1>
<p>Okay, so past some characteristic length both spiral and elliptical galaxies
have constant rotation velocity. What path do stars take as these spin around in them?  </p>
<p>As part of an assignment for a class recently, I looked at the path a single
star travels, over billions of years, in a simple model of a galaxy (a 'Mestel
potential'). Some of these figures looked pretty cool, so I figured I would
share them! I set up the markers to tick about 50 times per radial orbit.
The images shown are for 50, 100, 200, 300, ..., 1000 orbits.</p>

<h3>We're going to learn about many new planets in your lifetime. Here's a primer on how we got here, as well as a plug for a project that'll find hundreds, if not thousands of new planets.</h3>
<hr />
<h2>Hi there internet friend,</h2>
<p>I want to tell you about an exciting project coming soon to a neighborhood near you.
I'm stoked on this and you should be too.<sup id="fnref:fn-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fn-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This <em>project</em> is a telescope. It'll be mounted on a satellite that will be
fired to space in mid-2017.
It's going to find planets that orbit nearby stars.
I've talked a bit about these "exoplanets" in earlier posts, but what follows is
an (incomplete) bit of context on the "search for planets". If you're not interested
in history, scroll down for the "why do I care?"</p>
<h3>The search for other planets</h3>
<ul>
<li>50,000BC, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity#Continuity_hypothesis">behavioral modernity</a>,
  to 1200BC: you would have to be very observant to think
  that there was more than the Sun, the Moon, and twinkling stars. If you <em>were</em>
  very observant, you might notice the different-colored, different-moving
  dots in the sky that are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.</li>
<li>3500 years ago (1200BC): first known records of planets in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_star_catalogues">Babylonian star
  catalogs</a>. These
  catalogs reference older catalogs, but this is more-or-less the start of recorded
  astronomy. If we're living then and are lucky enough to access these texts, we
  know about 7 "celestial bodies" (Sun, Moon, Mercury,
  Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn). We probably don't think of our Earth as
  one of them.</li>
<li>Big step forward: 1610 AD. Dutch spectacle-makers invent the telescope, and
  the designs find their way to Galileo in Italy. He uses them to build
  his own telescope and finds four of Jupiter's moons in a single year.
  Makes history. Throughout the 17th century, Cassini and
  Huygens discover some of Saturn's moons, and in</li>
<li>1781 Herschel discovers Uranus.</li>
<li>1846 Galle mathematically predicts Neptune's existence and points Le Verrier
    to its discovery.</li>
<li>Post-1850: more moons; Pluto (Tombaugh). Telescopes improve, and it turns
  out that the Solar System's outer gas giants have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_satellites#List"><em>a lot</em> of moons</a>. By
  now, we've figured out that moons and planets are different, if for any
  reason because the planets orbit the sun, while the satellites (moons) orbit
  host-planets. We've also become familiar with our own blue dot's place in this
  arrangement: third-closest to the Sun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok. Let's take a breather, in maybe 1991. <em>Smells Like Teen Spirit</em> just broke, and
we know about the 9 planets you heard about in school:
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto.<sup id="fnref:fn-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fn-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
Along the way, a few astronomers have claimed detection of planets around
other stars, but none of these claims stand up to further observation.
Things are about to change.</p>
<ul>
<li>1992: Frail and Wolszczan discover two planets orbiting a pulsar (a
    highly magnetized, very dense star). These planets, poetically named
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1257%2B12">PSR B1257+12b and PSR B1257+12c</a>
    after their host star, are the first confirmed exoplanets in an oncoming torrent.</li>
<li>1995: First planet around a "normal" (main sequence) star (Mayor and Queloz,
    both from the University of Geneva). Dubbed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/51_Pegasi_b">51 Pegasi b</a>,
    it's an abnormal planet: it orbits its star in about 4 <em>days</em> (1/20th that of Mercury), but
    has a mass comparable to <em>Jupiter's</em>.</li>
<li>Post-1995: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoveries_of_exoplanets">More planets!</a>
    A mix of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exoplanet_search_projects">ground-based and space-based searches</a>
    yield over <strong>two thousand</strong> known extrasolar planets.
    About <em>half</em> of these are discovered by a space-based telescope called <em>Kepler</em>.</li>
<li>From 2009 to 2013, <em>Kepler</em> records the brightness of around 150,000 stars
    on a roughly 10-by-10 degree patch of sky.
    When planets pass in front of the stars from our line of sight, the shadow cast
    on us is observed as a predictable brightness dip (check out <a href="http://www.planethunters.org/">Planethunters</a> to
    see it for yourself). This leads to now over 1000 of the total 2000 known,
    with many more candidates counting.</li>
</ul>
<h3><em>This is all great, but why should you care about other planets?</em></h3>
<h2>The first indications of life on other planets could likely come from this planet discovery effort.</h2>
<p>This deserves another post in itself.
The basic idea is: a planet passes in front of its host star (and we observe the
  "transiting" system as a single point of light on the sky). Some of the light
  passing through the exoplanet's atmosphere is absorbed by its gases, causing an
  observable shift in the spectrum of light from the system as we observe it.
  Earth's atmosphere has "biosignature gases" - gases that couldn't maintain the
  abundances they do without a lifecycle replenishing them.<sup id="fnref:fn-3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fn-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Studying the atmospheric spectra of exoplanets is a
major step towards answering an age-old question: <strong>are we alone?</strong></p>
<h2>The more we know about other planets, the more we can understand our own.</h2>
<p>Relational knowledge is a core component of human understanding. How can I understand
how much I like a food without some reference to other foods? Similarly, how
could I hope to understand Earth's story without knowing
the stories of other planets? How did they form? What are they made of? Are
Earth-like planets common? Preliminary answers to these questions are already coming
from exoplanet-searching efforts.</p>
<h2>This is a frontier of exploration and discovery.</h2>
<p>Fairly self-explanatory. Simply put: early cartographers drew incomplete
world maps. The field of exoplanets produces galaxy maps, at the level of "if I had
an interstellar spacecraft, where would I visit?"</p>
<p>Now, here's that promised plug:</p>
<h2>A major exoplanet-searching telescope called <em>TESS</em> (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) will launch in 2017 and discover hundreds of new planets. Many of these planets will resemble Earth, and their atmospheres will be easier to study than almost any known exoplanets.</h2>

</ul>
<p>I'm going to be writing about <em>TESS</em>, along with the field of exoplanets and
my journey through it, on this blog-space. Swing by every now and then, we'll
learn together!</p>
