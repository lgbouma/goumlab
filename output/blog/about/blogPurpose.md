# Blog purpose:
This blog is a place to keep track of all the wonderful things that I'll be learning in graduate school. I'll be diving into a physics program, and I'm expecting to start working on:

* Astrophysics 
* Exoplanets
* Scientific computing (if I have a choice, in Python)

If what I have to say about those topics (or others, as we go along) interests you, awesome! Posts in `learning` are going to be chiefly for my benefit, while posts in `computation` and `research` will be tailored to broader audiences.
