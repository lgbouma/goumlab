# Blog purpose:
Welcome!
This blog is a place to share and discuss some of the wonderful things that I'll
be learning in graduate school. I'm a physics student. Most of what
I expect to write about here will cover:

* Astrophysics
* Exoplanets
* Doing cool things with computers (physics, statistics, art, music, ...)

If what I have to say about these topics (or others, as we go along) interests
you, awesome! Posts in `learning` will exhibit what I'm processing
in my coursework and reading,
while posts in `computation` and `exoplanets` will be tailored more broadly
towards code that I write, or research ideas that I'm hashing out.
