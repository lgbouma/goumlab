<p>Hi there internet friend,</p>
<p>I'd like to tell you about a really exciting thing that is coming soon to a
neighborhood near you.
I am really, really stoked on this and you should be too<sup id="fnref:fn-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fn-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This <em>thing</em> is going to find planets that orbit nearby stars.
By itself, this is already awesome. I've talked a bit about these "exoplanets"
in earlier posts, but here's a brief (insanely oversimplified) history:</p>
<ul>
<li>50,000BC, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity#Continuity_hypothesis">behavioral modernity</a>,
  to 1200BC: you would have to be quite an observant human to think
  that there was more than the Sun and the Moon. If you <em>were</em> very observant,
  you might notice the funny, different-colored dots in the sky that
  are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.</li>
<li>3500 years ago (1200BC): first known records of planets in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_star_catalogues">Babylonian star
  catalogs</a>. These
  catalogs reference older catalogs, but more or less this is the start of known
  astronomy. If we're living then and are lucky enough to access these texts, we
  we know about 7 "celestial bodies" (Sun, Moon, Mercury,
  Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn).</li>
<li>Not much new until 1610 AD. Dutch spectacle-makers invent the telescope, and
  the designs find their way to Galileo in Italy. He uses them to build
  his own telescope and finds four of Jupiter's moons in a single year.
  Basically makes history. Throughout the 17th century, Cassini and
  Huygens discover some of Saturn's moons, and in</li>
<li>1781 Herschel discovers Uranus.</li>
<li>1846 Galle predicts Neptune's existence, Le Verrier looks and confirms it.</li>
<li>Post-1850: more moons; Pluto (Tombaugh). Telescopes improve, and it turns
  out that the Solar System's outer gas giants have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_satellites#List"><em>a lot</em> of moons</a>. By
  now, we've figured out that moons and planets are different, if for any
  reason because the planets orbit the sun, while the satellites (moons) orbit
  host-planets. We've also become familiar with our own blue dot's place in this
  arrangement: third-closest to the Sun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok. Let's take a breather, in maybe 1991. Kurt Cobain is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg">turning out the
lights</a> with Dave Grohl (later
Foo Fighters lead vocals) rocking the drums, and we know about the 9
planets you probably learned about in elementary school:
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto
(meta-acronym: my very easy method just speeds up naming planets).
Along the way, many astronomers have claimed detection of planets around
stars other than our own, but none of these claims stood up to further
observations.
Things are about to change. </p>
<ul>
<li>1992: Frail and Wolszczan discover two planets orbiting a pulsar (a
    highly magnetized, very dense star). These planets, poetically named
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1257%2B12">PSR B1257+12b and PSR B1257+12c</a>
    after their host star, are the first confirmed exoplanets in an oncoming torrent.</li>
<li>1995: First planet around a "normal" (main sequence) star (Mayor and Queloz,
    both from the University of Geneva). Dubbed 51 Pegasi b, it's an abnormal
    planet: it orbits its star in about 4 <em>days</em> (1/20th that of Mercury), but
    has a mass comparable to <em>Jupiter's</em>.</li>
<li>Post-1995: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoveries_of_exoplanets">More planets</a>!
    Getting</li>
</ul>
<p>called <em>TESS</em>, which is an acronym for the Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite.</p>
<p>'m
definitely biased, because I'll actually be <em>contributing</em> to it, but regardless
I am really, really stoked on it.</p>
